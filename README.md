#  Ember Simple Auth

![Logo](http://ember-simple-auth.com/images/logo.png)

Ember Simple Auth is a __lightweight library for implementing authentication/
authorization with [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) applications__. It has
minimal requirements with respect to application structure, routes etc. With
its pluggable strategies it can support all kinds of authentication and
authorization mechanisms.

## What does it do?

* it __manages a client side session__ and synchronizes its state across tabs/
  windows
* it __authenticates the session__ against the application's own server, external
  providers like Facebook etc.
* it __authorizes requests__ to backend servers
* it is easily customizable and extensible

## How does it work?

Ember Simple Auth consists of 4 main building blocks - the session, a session store, authenticators and (optionally)
authorizers.

The __session__ is the main interface to the library. It provides methods for authentication and invalidation of the
session as well as to set and read session data. It's available as a service that can be injected wherever
needed in the application.

The __session store__ persists the session and all of its data so that it survives a page reload. It also synchronizes the authentication status
across multiple tabs or windows so that when the user logs out in one tab or window of the application, all sensitive data
is also cleared in other tabs or windows of the same application as well.

__Authenticators__ authenticate the session. They implement concrete mechanisms for verifying a user's identity so
that an application can support multiple ways of authentication such as username and password, Facebook or github
by leveraging multiple authenticators.

__Authorizers__ use the authentication data retrieved by an authenticator and stored in the session to generate
authorization data that can then be injected into outgoing requests such as Ember Data requests. The server can then
use that authorization data to identify the user making the request and decide whether it's allowed or not.

## How do I use it?

Installing the library is as easy as:

```bash
ember install ember-simple-auth
```

### The Session

Once the library is installed, the session service can be injected wherever needed in the application.

In order to display login/logout buttons in a `main-menu` component depending on the session's authentication state, simply query the
session's `isAuthenticated` property:

```js
// app/components/main-menu.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  session: Ember.inject.service('session')
});
```

```handlebars
{{!-- app/templates/components/main-menu.js --}}
{{#if session.isAuthenticated}}
  <a {{ action 'invalidateSession' }}>Logout</a>
{{else}}
  {{#link-to 'login'}}Login{{/link-to}}
{{/if}}
```

and in the `invalidateSession` action, use the session service's `invalidate` method to
invalidate the session and log the user out.

```js
// app/components/main-menu.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  session: Ember.inject.service('session'),

  actions: {
    invalidateSession: function() {
      this.get('session').invalidate();
    }
  }
});
```

To authenticate the session, the session service provides the `authenticate` method that takes the name of the
authenticator to use as well as arguments depending on the authenticator. Given a login form component

```handlebars
<form {{action 'authenticate' on='submit'}}>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="identification">Login</label>
    {{input value=identification placeholder='Enter Login' class='form-control'}}
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="password">Password</label>
    {{input value=password placeholder='Enter Password' class='form-control' type='password'}}
  </div>
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-default">Login</button>
</form>
```

the implementation is as easy as:

```js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  session: Ember.inject.service('session'),

  actions: {
    authenticate() {
      let data = this.getProperties('identification', 'password');
      this.get('session').authenticate('authenticator:oauth2', data).catch((reason) => {
        this.set('errorMessage', reason.error);
      });
    }
  }
});
```

The session service also provides the `sessionAuthenticated` and `sessionInvalidated` events that
are triggered whenever the session is successfully authenticated or invalidated (which not only happens
when the user submits the login form or clicks the login button but also when the session is authenticated
or invalidated in another tab or window which will then be synchronized to other tabs via the session store).
To have these events handled in the default way automatically, simply mixin the `ApplicationRouteMixin`
in the application route:

```js
// app/routes/application.js
import Ember from 'ember';
import ApplicationRouteMixin from 'ember-simple-auth/mixins/application-route-mixin';

export default Ember.Route.extend(ApplicationRouteMixin);
```

To make a route in the application require the session to be authenticated,
there is another mixin that Ember Simple Auth provides and that is included in
the respective route (see the
[API docs for `AuthenticatedRouteMixin`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/ember-simple-auth-api-docs.html#SimpleAuth-AuthenticatedRouteMixin)):

```js
// app/routes/protected.js
import AuthenticatedRouteMixin from 'ember-simple-auth/mixins/authenticated-route-mixin';

export default Ember.Route.extend(AuthenticatedRouteMixin);
```

This will make the route transition to `/login` (or a different URL if
configured) when the session is not authenticated in the `beforeModel` method.

To prevent a route from being accessed when the session is authenticated (which
makes sense for the `login` route for example), use the
[`UnauthenticatedRouteMixin`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/ember-simple-auth-api-docs.html#SimpleAuth-UnauthenticatedRouteMixin)).

### Authenticators

__Authenticators implement the concrete steps necessary to authenticate the
session.__ An application can have several authenticators for different kinds
of authentication mechanisms (e.g. the application's own backend server,
external authentication providers like Facebook etc.) while the session is only
authenticated with one authenticator at a time (see the
[API docs for `Session#authenticate`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/ember-simple-auth-api-docs.html#SimpleAuth-Session-authenticate)).
The authenticator to use is chosen when authentication is triggered:

```js
this.get('session').authenticate('authenticator:some', {});
```

Ember Simple Auth comes with 3 authenticators:

* `OAuth2PasswordGrantAuthenticator`: an OAuth 2.0 authenticator that implements the _"Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant Type"_
* `DeviseAuthenticator`: an authenticator compatible with the popular Ruby on Rails authentication plugin [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
* `ToriiAuthenticator`: an authenticator that wraps the [torii library](https://github.com/Vestorly/torii)

To use one of these authenticator in an application, simply extend it:

```js
// app/authenticators/oauth2.js
import OAuth2PasswordGrantAuthenticator from 'ember-simple-auth/authenticators/oauth2-password-grant';

export default OAuth2PasswordGrantAuthenticator.extend();
```

This authenticator can then be used to authenticate the session as follows:

```js
this.get('session').authenticate('authenticator:some', data)
```

#### Implementing a custom Authenticator

Besides the option to use one of the predefined authenticators, it is easy to implement custom authenticators as well. All
that is necessary is to extend the base authenticator and implement three
methods (see the
[API docs for `Authenticators.Base`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/ember-simple-auth-api-docs.html#SimpleAuth-Authenticators-Base)),
e.g.:

```js
// app/authenticators/custom.js
import BaseAuthenticator from 'ember-simple-auth/authenticators/base';

export default BaseAuthenticator.extend({
  restore: function(data) {
    …
  },
  authenticate: function(options) {
    …
  },
  invalidate: function(data) {
    …
  }
});
```

This authenticator can then be used to authenticate the session as follows:

```js
this.get('session').authenticate('authenticator:custom', {});
```

### Authorizers

Ember Simple Auth defines authorizers to use data obtained on session authentication
to e.g. authorize backend requests. While the authenticator acquires some sort of secret information from an
authentication provider when it authenticates the session, __the authorizer
uses that secret information acquired by the authenticator to authorize
subsequent requests, thus the authenticator and authorizer have to fit
together__.

Ember Simple Auth comes with 2 authorizers:

* `OAuth2BearerAuthorizer`: an OAuth 2.0 authorizer that uses Bearer tokens
* `DeviseAuthorizer`: an authorizer compatible with the popular Ruby on Rails authentication plugin [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)

Unlike in previous versions of Ember Simple Auth, authorization will not happen automatically for
all requests the application makes anymore but has to be done explicitly via the service. Therefor the service
defines the `authorize` method that calls a specified callback with the authorization data if the session is
authenticated:

```js
this.get('session').authorize('authorizer:some', (authorizationData) => {
  // do sth. with the authorizationData
});
```

When using Ember Data this would be added to the application adapter to inject an `Authorization` into requests so
that the API can identify the user issuing the request. As that is a very common case though there is the
`DataAdapterMixin` to simplify this:

```js
import DS from 'ember-data';
import DataAdapterMixin from 'ember-simple-auth/mixins/data-adapter-mixin';

export default DS.JSONAPIAdapter.extend(DataAdapterMixin, {
  authorizer: 'authorizer:application'
});
```

**If you set the authorizer to authorizer:application** you need to create an `authorizers/application.js` inside your application (app/authorizers/applications.js). See the following section on implementing a custom authorizer.


#### Implementing a custom Authorizer

Besides the option to use one of the predefined authorizers from the extension
libraries, it is easy to implement custom authorizers as well. All you have to
do is to extend the base authorizer and implement one method (see the
[API docs for `Authorizers.Base`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/ember-simple-auth-api-docs.html#SimpleAuth-Authorizers-Base)).

```js
// app/authorizers/custom.js
import BaseAuthorizer from 'ember-simple-auth/authorizers/base';

export default BaseAuthorizer.extend({
  authorize(block) {
    …
  }
});
```

For instance if you wanted to use the popular Json Web Tokens mechanism which involves sending an `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header in each request you could implement the authorizer like the following:

```javascript
import Ember from 'ember';
import Base from 'ember-simple-auth/authorizers/base';

const { isEmpty } = Ember;

export default Base.extend({
  authorize(block) {
    const accessToken = this.get('session.authenticated.token');
    if (this.get('session.isAuthenticated') && !isEmpty(accessToken)) {
      block('Authorization', `Bearer ${accessToken}`);
    }
  }

});

```

### Stores

Ember Simple Auth __persists the session state so it survives page reloads__.
There is only one store per application that can be configured in the application's
environment object:

```js
//config/environment.js
ENV['ember-simple-auth'] = {
  base {
  	store: 'session-store:local-storage'
  }
}
```

#### Store Types

Ember Simple Auth comes with 2 bundled stores:

##### `localStorage` Store

The `localStorage` store (see the
[API docs for `Stores.LocalStorage`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/ember-simple-auth-api-docs.html#SimpleAuth-Stores-LocalStorage))
stores its data in the browser's `localStorage`; __this is the default store__.

##### Ephemeral Store

The ephemeral store (see the
[API docs for `Stores.Ephemeral`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/ember-simple-auth-api-docs.html#SimpleAuth-Stores-Ephemeral))
stores its data in memory and thus __is not actually persistent__. This store
is mainly useful for testing. Also the ephemeral store cannot keep multiple
tabs or windows in sync as tabs/windows cannot share memory.

A cookie based store is available in the extension library
[__simple-auth-cookie-store__](packages/ember-simple-auth-cookie-store).

#### Implementing a custom Store

Implementing a custom store is as easy as implementing custom authenticators or
authorizers. All you have to do is to extend the base store and implement three
methods (see the
[API docs for `Stores.Base`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/ember-simple-auth-api-docs.html#SimpleAuth-Stores-Base)).

## Testing

Ember Simple Auth comes with a set up test helpers that help testing
authentication:

* `currentSession()`: provides access to the current session.
* `authenticateSession(sessionData)`: authenticates the session; the optional
  `sessionData` argument can be used to mock an authenticator response - e.g.
  a token.
* `invalidateSession()`: invalidates the session.

## Dummy app

Ember Simple Auth comes with a dummy app that shows how to use it. To run it,
clone the repository and start the Ember server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth.git
cd ember-simple-auth
npm install
bower install
ember serve
```

Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to access the app.

## Installation

Ember Simple Auth is distributed as an Ember CLI Addon so installation is as
easy as:

```bash
ember install ember-simple-auth
```

## Configuration

Ember Simple Auth is configured via the `'ember-simple-auth'` section in the
application's `config/environment.js` file. See the
[API docs](http://ember-simple-auth.com/ember-simple-auth-api-docs.html#SimpleAuth-Configuration))
for the available settings.


The configuration object can have the following options:

```javascript
ENV['ember-simple-auth'] = {
  base: {
    authenticationRoute:         'login',
    routeAfterAuthentication:    'index',
    routeIfAlreadyAuthenticated: 'index',
    store:                       'session-store:ephemeral'
  },
  localStorage: {
    key: 'ember_simple_auth:session'
  },
  cookie: {
    name:           'ember_simple_auth:session',
    domain:         null,
    expirationTime: null
  }
}
```
The `base` object has the following properties

* authenticationRoute: The route to transition to for authentication.
* routeAfterAuthentication: The route to transition to after successful authentication.
* routeIfAlreadyAuthenticated: The route to transition to if a route that implements 
      [`UnauthenticatedRouteMixin`](#SimpleAuth-UnauthenticatedRouteMixin) is
      accessed when the session is authenticated.
* store: The name of the store where to persist session information (you can choose between `session-ephemeral`, `session-local-storage`, `session-cookie`)

If you're using the `local-storage` store you can configure the key where the session information will be saved.

```javascript
localStorage: {
  key: 'ember_simple_auth:session'
}
```
The default key is `ember_simple_auth:session`
