#  Ember.SimpleAuth

__It is recommended to run Ember.SimpleAuth with Ember.js 1.2 or greater (see
[issue #21](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/issues/21))__

Ember.SimpleAuth is a lightweight library for implementing token based
authentication/authorization with [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) applications.
It has minimal requirements with respect to the application structure, routes
etc.

While it follows the [RFC 6749](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and
[RFC 6750](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750) specifications it can support a
wide range of different server APIs and also external OAuth/OpenID providers
like Facebook, Google etc. with little customization effort.

## RFC 6749

RFC 6749 is the IETF specification that defines the OAuth 2.0 Authorization
framework. It defines a series of grant types of which the _"[Resource Owner
Password Credentials Grant Type]
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3)"_ is used by Ember.SimpleAuth.
It defines the process of acquiring an authorization token from a server in
exchange for a valid pair of credentials (username and password).

The token is then sent in the standard HTTP `Authorization` header along with
every subsequent request:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access token>
```

For now, Ember.SimpleAuth only supports bearer tokens (see
[RFC 6750](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750) for more information on this
token type).

__As the `Authorization` header is sent with every AJAX request the application
makes (Ember.SimpleAuth uses a
[jQuery AJAX prefilter](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxPrefilter) to inject
the header in the request), all kinds of data adapters etc. are supported out
of the box.__

## External OAuth/OpenID Providers

Additionally to servers compliant to RFC 6749, Ember.SimpleAuth can also be
used with external OpenID or OAuth providers like
[Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/getting-started-web/),
[Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth) or
[Google](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OpenID) which can easily
be integrated. For an example see the _"External OAuth example"_ in the
[examples list](#examples).

## Custom Server Protocols

Ember.SimpleAuth can also be used with your own custom server protocol. This
requires a little more integration work though (see the _"Custom Server
example"_ in the [examples list](#examples)). However, there is a wide range of
middlewares available for different languages and frameworks that support the
OAuth 2.0 standard so you might want to consider using one of those instead of
running your own incompatible solution.

## Usage

To enable Ember.SimpleAuth in your application, simply add a custom
initializer:

```js
Ember.Application.initializer({
  name: 'authentication',
  initialize: function(container, application) {
    Ember.SimpleAuth.setup(container, application);
  }
});
```

The application route must implement the mixin provided by Ember.SimpleAuth so
that the `login` and `logout` actions are available:

```js
App.ApplicationRoute = Ember.Route.extend(Ember.SimpleAuth.ApplicationRouteMixin);
```

The current session that stores the authentication status, the access token
etc. can be accessed as `session` in all models, views, controllers and routes.
To e.g. display login/logout buttons depending on whether the user is currently
authenticated or not, simply add something like this to the respective
template:

```html
{{#if session.isAuthenticated}}
  <a {{ action 'logout' }}>Logout</a>
{{else}}
  <a {{ action 'login' }}>Login</a>
{{/if}}
```

To actually make a route in the application protected and inaccessible when no
user is authenticated, simply implement the
`Ember.SimpleAuth.AuthenticatedRouteMixin` in the respective route:

```js
App.Router.map(function() {
  this.route('protected');
});
App.ProtectedRoute = Ember.Route.extend(Ember.SimpleAuth.AuthenticatedRouteMixin);
```

This will make the route redirect to `/login` (or a different URL if configured
) when no user is authenticated in the `beforeModel` hook.

To actually authenticate the user and obtain the access token there are two
options: the one using a login form that sends a set of credentials to a server
and in exchange receives the access token or to integrate an OAuth/OpenID
provider.

### Login Form

When using a login form to authenticate the user, the first thing that is
needed in the Ember.js application is a login route. This can be named anything
you want:

```js
App.Router.map(function() {
  this.route('login');
});
```

To wire this up with Ember.SimpleAuth, the login controller needs to implement
the respective mixin:

```js
App.LoginController = Ember.Controller.extend(Ember.SimpleAuth.LoginControllerMixin);
```

The last step is to add a template that renders the login form:

```html
<form {{action login on='submit'}}>
  <label for="identification">Login</label>
  {{view Ember.TextField id='identification' valueBinding='identification' placeholder='Enter Login'}}
  <label for="password">Password</label>
  {{view Ember.TextField id='password' type='password' valueBinding='password' placeholder='Enter Password'}}
  <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>
```

As the controller implements the mixin as described above, form submission,
session setup etc. will be handled by Ember.SimpleAuth.

### External OAuth/OpenID provider

When using an external authentication provider to authenticate the user, there
is a little custom code necessary. Instead of implementing a login route that
renders a form you need to override the `App.ApplicationRoute`'s `login` action
so that it opens a new window that displays the external provider's UI for
logging in. If you're using Facebook that would look something like this:

```js
App.ApplicationRoute = Ember.Route.extend(Ember.SimpleAuth.ApplicationRouteMixin, {
  actions: {
    login: function() {
      window.open(
        'https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?client_id=<your app id>&redirect_uri=<your callback URI>'
      );
    }
  }
});
```

When Facebook redirects to your callback URI, your server identifies the user
by the Facebook OAuth token and renders a response that invokes the
`externalLoginSucceeded` callback in it's opener window:

```html
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
  <script>
    window.opener.Ember.SimpleAuth.externalLoginSucceeded({ access_token: '<access token>' });
    window.close();
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

This will set up the current session and redirect to the correct route.

If the external authentication fails, your server renders something like this:

```html
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
  <script>
    window.opener.Ember.SimpleAuth.externalLoginFailed({ error: 'invalid_grant' });
    window.close();
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

To intercept this error and for example display an error message, you can
override the `loginFailed` action of the `App.ApplicationRoute`:

```js
App.ApplicationRoute = Ember.Route.extend(Ember.SimpleAuth.ApplicationRouteMixin, {
  actions: {
    loginFailed: function(errorMessage) {
      this.controllerFor('application').set('loginErrorMessage', errorMessage);
    }
  }
});
```

For a more complete example see the _"External OAuth example"_ in the
[examples](#examples) list.

## The Client/Server API

The client/server API as specified for the _"Resource Owner Password
Credentials Grant"_ in RFC 6749 is actually quite simple. The client sends a
request including the grant type as well as the user's username and password to
the server's token endpoint:

```
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=password&username=johndoe&password=A3ddj3w
```

The server then either answers with a successful response including the bearer
token:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
  "access_token":"2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
  "token_type":"bearer"
}
```

or with an error:

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
  "error":"invalid_grant"
}
```

For more documentation of the specified error codes, see [the respective
section of RC 6749](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-5.2).

### Token Expiration and Refresh

The server can also include an expiry for the access token as well as an
additional refresh token in the successful response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
  "access_token":"2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
  "token_type":"bearer",
  "expires_in":3600,
  "refresh_token":"tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA"
}
```

Refresh tokens are usually valid for longer than access tokens and can be used
to obtain fresh access tokens when these are expired or even before they
expire. If the server supports refresh tokens, Ember.SimpleAuth will
automatically refresh access tokens about 5 seconds before they expire. The
request is similar to the initial request for acquiring the token but instead
of using the grant type `password` and submitting the user's credentials it
uses grant type `refresh_token` and only includes the refresh token:

```
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA
```

The response for this request is the same as the success and error responses
described above.

### The `Authorization` header

Once the access token has successfully been obtained from the server, all
subsequent request the client sends will includes the `Authorization` header.
The server uses that token to identify the user making the request:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access token>
```

**As the access token is sent without any further encryption etc. you should
make sure you're always using TLS/HTTPS for all client/server communication!**

### Custom Servers

In order to use a custom server that is not compliant to RFC 6749, there are
only two things that need to be customized: the construction of the request
that is sent to the server to obtain the access token and the parsing of the
server's response. To customize the request, simply override the
`tokenRequestOptions` method in the login controller, e.g.:

```js
App.LoginController  = Ember.Controller.extend(Ember.SimpleAuth.LoginControllerMixin, {
  tokenRequestOptions: function(username, password) {
    var data = '{ "SESSION": { "USER_NAME": "' + username + '", "PASS": "' + password + '" } }';
    return { type: 'PUT', data: data, contentType: 'application/json' };
  }
});
```

In this case the request that is sent to obtain the token will be a `PUT`
request with JSON data instead of the standard `POST` with form-encoded data.

To customize the parsing of the server's response, override the `setup` method
of Ember.SimpleAuth.Session, e.g.:

```js
Ember.SimpleAuth.Session.reopen({
  setup: function(serverSession) {
    this.set('authToken', serverSession.SESSION.TOKEN);
  }
});
```

## Configuration

Ember.SimpleAuth offers some configuration settings that allow to customize
parts of the library without actually changing/overriding any code:

```js
Ember.SimpleAuth.setup(container, application, {
  routeAfterLogin: ...     // route to redirect the user to after successfully logging in - defaults to 'index'
  routeAfterLogout: ...    // route to redirect the user to after logging out - defaults to 'index'
  loginRoute: ...          // route to redirect the user to when login is required - defaults to 'login'
  serverTokenEndpoint: ... // the server endpoint used to obtain the access token - defaults to '/token'
  serverHost: ...          // absolute server host if the api is on another domain - defaults to '' (relative request)
  autoRefreshToken: ...    // enable/disable automatic token refreshing (if the server supports it) - defaults to true
});
```

## Examples

To run the examples you need to have Ruby (at least version 1.9.3) and the
[bundler gem](http://bundler.io) installed. If you have that, you can run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth.git
cd ember-simple-auth/examples
bundle
./runner
```

Open [http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567) to access the examples.

## Installation

To install Ember.SimpleAuth in you Ember.js application you have several
options:

* If you're using [Bower](http://bower.io), just add it to your
  `bower.json` file:

```js
{
  "dependencies": {
    "ember-simple-auth": "https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth-component.git"
  }
}
```

* Download a prebuilt version from
  [the releases page](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/releases)
* [Build it yourself](#building)

## Building

To build Ember.SimpleAuth yourself you need to have Ruby (at least version
1.9.3) and the [bundler gem](http://bundler.io) installed. If you have that,
building is as easy as running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth.git
cd ember-simple-auth
bundle
bundle exec rake dist
```

After running that you will find the compiled source file (including a minified
version) in the `dist` directory.

If you want to run the tests as well you also need
[PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org). You can run the tests with:

```bash
bundle exec rake test
```
