  The base for all store types. __This serves as a starting point for
  implementing custom stores and must not be used directly.__

  Stores may trigger the `'ember-simple-auth:session-updated'` event when
  any of the stored properties changes due to external actions (e.g. from
  another tab). The session listens to that event and will handle the changes
  accordingly. Whenever the event is triggered by the store, the session will
  forward all properties to its authenticator which might lead to the session
  being invalidated (see
  [EmberSimpleAuth.Authenticators.Base#restore](#EmberSimpleAuth-Authenticators-Base-restore)).
