/**
  This mixin is for the controller that handles the
  [`Configuration.authenticationRoute`](#SimpleAuth-Configuration-authenticationRoute)
  if the used authentication mechanism works with a login form that asks for
  user credentials. It provides the `authenticate` action that will
  authenticate the session with the configured authenticator when invoked.
  __This is a specialization of
  [`AuthenticationControllerMixin`](#SimpleAuth-AuthenticationControllerMixin).__

  Accompanying the controller that this mixin is mixed in the application needs
  to have a `login` template with the fields `identification` and `password` as
  well as an actionable button or link that triggers the `authenticate` action,
  e.g.:

  ```handlebars
  <form {{action 'authenticate' on='submit'}}>
    <label for="identification">Login</label>
    {{input value=identification placeholder='Enter Login'}}
    <label for="password">Password</label>
    {{input value=password placeholder='Enter Password' type='password'}}
    <button type="submit">Login</button>
  </form>
  ```

  @class LoginControllerMixin
  @namespace SimpleAuth
  @module simple-auth/mixins/login-controller-mixin
  @extends SimpleAuth.AuthenticationControllerMixin
*/
export default Ember.Mixin.create(AuthenticationControllerMixin, {
  actions: {
    /**
      This action will authenticate the session with the configured
      authenticator (see
      [AuthenticationControllerMixin#authenticator](#SimpleAuth-Authentication-authenticator))
      if both `identification` and `password` are non-empty. It passes both
      values to the authenticator.

      __The action also resets the `password` property so sensitive data does
      not stay in memory for longer than necessary.__

      @method actions.authenticate
    */
    authenticate: function() {
      var data = this.getProperties('identification', 'password');
      this.set('password', null);
      return this._super(data);
    }
  }
});
