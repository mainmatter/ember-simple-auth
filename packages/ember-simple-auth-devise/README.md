# Ember Simple Auth Devise

This is an extension to the Ember Simple Auth library that provides an
authenticator and an authorizer that are compatible with customized
installations of [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise).

__As your user's credentials as well as the token are exchanged between the
Ember.js app and the Rails server you have to make sure that this connection
uses HTTPS!__

## Server-side setup

__These instructions assume you're using the default Devise configuration and
models. If you're using a custom model or attribute names, you can
[configure Ember Simple Auth Devise to work with those](http://ember-simple-auth.com/ember-simple-auth-devise-api-docs.html#SimpleAuth-Configuration-Devise)).__

As token authentication is not actually part of Devise anymore, there are some
customizations necessary on the server side (most of this is adapted from
[José Valim's gist on token authentication](https://gist.github.com/josevalim/fb706b1e933ef01e4fb6)).

First, a new column for the authentication token must be added to the users
table:

```ruby
class AddAuthenticationTokenToUser < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :users, :authentication_token, :string
  end
end
```

That authentication token must be auto-generated by the model on creation:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  before_save :ensure_authentication_token

  def ensure_authentication_token
    if authentication_token.blank?
      self.authentication_token = generate_authentication_token
    end
  end

  private

    def generate_authentication_token
      loop do
        token = Devise.friendly_token
        break token unless User.where(authentication_token: token).first
      end
    end
end
```

By default, Devise's sessions controller only responds to HTML request. In
order for it to work with Ember Simple Auth it must also respond to JSON. To
achieve that, define a custom sessions controller (_if HTML responses are not
needed the format handling can be left out of course_):

```ruby
class SessionsController < Devise::SessionsController
  respond_to :html, :json

  def create
    super do |user|
      if request.format.json?
        data = {
          token: user.authentication_token,
          email: user.email
        }
        render json: data, status: 201 and return
      end
    end
  end
end
```

and configure Devise to use that controller instead of the default one:

```ruby
MyRailsApp::Application.routes.draw do
  devise_for :users, controllers: { sessions: 'sessions' }
end
```

Finally, the Rails application must authenticate users by their authentication
token and email if present:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_filter :authenticate_user_from_token!

  # Enter the normal Devise authentication path,
  # using the token authenticated user if available
  before_filter :authenticate_user!

  private

  def authenticate_user_from_token!
    authenticate_with_http_token do |token, options|
      user_email = options[:email].presence
      user = user_email && User.find_by_email(user_email)

      if user && Devise.secure_compare(user.authentication_token, token)
        sign_in user, store: false
      end
    end
  end
end
```

The Rails application should also not issue session cookies but authentication
should be done exclusively via the authentication token as described above. The
easiest way to disable sessions in Rails is to add an initializer
`config/initializers/session_store.rb` and disable the session store in that:

```rb
Rails.application.config.session_store :disabled
```

If disabling sessions completely is not an option, make sure no session cookies
are sent for JSON requests as
[described here](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/issues/285).

__If the server sends session cookies to the Ember frontend this will lead to
the situation that the user is actually still logged in after Ember Simple Auth
invalidates the session__ as the Rails session cookie will still be present
because Ember Simple Auth does not know anything about that cookie and will not
delete it on session invalidation!

## The Authenticator

In order to use the Devise authenticator (see the
[API docs for `Authenticators.Devise`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/ember-simple-auth-devise-api-docs.html#SimpleAuth-Authenticators-Devise))
the application needs to have a login route:

```js
App.Router.map(function() {
  this.route('login');
});
```

This route displays the login form with fields for `identification`,
`password`:

```html
<form {{action 'authenticate' on='submit'}}>
  <label for="identification">Login</label>
  {{input value=identification placeholder='Enter Login'}}
  <label for="password">Password</label>
  {{input value=password placeholder='Enter Password' type='password'}}
  <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>
```

The `authenticate` action authenticates the session with the
`'simple-auth-authenticator:devise'` authenticator:

```js
authenticate: function() {
  var data = this.getProperties('identification', 'password');
  return this.get('session').authenticate('simple-auth-authenticator:devise', data);
}
```

## The Authorizer

The authorizer (see the
[API docs for `Authorizers.Devise`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/ember-simple-auth-devise-api-docs.html#SimpleAuth-Authorizers-Devise))
authorizes requests by adding `token` and `email` properties from the
session in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Token token="<token>", email="<email>"
```

To use the authorizer, configure it on the application's environment object:

```js
//config/environment.js
ENV['simple-auth'] = {
  authorizer: 'simple-auth-authorizer:devise'
}
```

## Installation

To install Ember Simple Auth Devise in an Ember.js application there are
several options:

* If you're using [Ember CLI](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli), just
  add the
  [Ember CLI Addon](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-cli-simple-auth-devise)
  to your project and Ember Simple Auth Devise will setup itself.
* The Ember Simple Auth Devise extension library is also included in the
  _"ember-simple-auth"_ bower package both in a browserified version as well as
  an AMD build. If you're using the AMD build from bower be sure to require the
  autoloader:

  ```js
  require('simple-auth-devise/ember');
  ```

  The browserified version will, like the Ember CLI addon, also setup itself
  once it is loaded in the application.
* Download a prebuilt version from
  [the releases page](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/releases)
